	Just one, Kai.

What are the modifications you made to the game?

	Major: Timer

		A Timer that gives incentive to finish the game quickly!
		This adds a nice challenge to anyone who find the game to easy

	Minor: Speed Boost

		To coinside with the timer, the player can speed up with the space key!
		Use it carefully though, because it could make you run into a ghost.


	Note: Custom made music also added
